    agmerge is a replacement for the "hadd" command shipped with ROOT.
    	Unlike hadd, it only merges histograms, not ntuples or other
    	objects.  Unlike hadd, it does not crash when merging more
    	than a few dozen input files each containing many histograms
    	in mutliple nested subdirectories.  In fact agmerge can handle
    	an arbitrary number of input files: use the --stdin switch if
    	there are more files than the shell command line allows.
    
    agwmerge adds up histograms applying arbitrary per-file weights
    
    agxmerge adds up histograms and scales to a specified luminosity,
    	 taking into account sample cross sections.  Counts of
    	 generated events for each sample must be recorded in the
    	 input files (the --refh and --refbin parameters).
    
Other executables in this package are ATLAS specific.
